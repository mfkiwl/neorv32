.**Project is STABLE - even if work is in progress**
[TIP]
This project is under active development. Best care is taken to keep the project stable while working on new features. The whole processors is checked
before updates are pushed to the repository and even more tests are made before publishing new releases. +
 +
New features that are _work-in-progress_ - like new CPU extension - are disabled by default (and should not be enabled for normal usage). Like any other
disabled features, these work-in-progress components will not be synthesized at all when disabled and **do not** increase area and power requirements
and **do not** impact overall timing and performance.
